  !!! note
      Please be aware that once created, the CD pipeline remains with the chosen quality gate type without possibility to edit it.

  !!! info
      To trigger the CD pipeline, first, make sure that all applications have passed the Build pipelines and autotests have passed the single Code Review pipelines.

6. Navigate to Jenkins to see the autotest logs and Allure report.
