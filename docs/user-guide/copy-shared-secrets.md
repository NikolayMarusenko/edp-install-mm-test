# Copy Shared Secrets

The **Copy Shared Secrets** stage provides the ability to copy secrets from the current Kubernetes namespace into a namespace created during CD pipeline.

Please follow the steps described below to copy the secrets:

1. Create a secret in the current Kubernetes namespace that should be used in the deployment. The secret label must be `app.edp.epam.com/use: cicd`, since the pipeline script will attempt to copy the secret by its label. For example:

      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        labels:
          app.edp.epam.com/use: cicd

2. Add the following step to the CD pipeline `{"name":"copy-secrets","step_name":"copy-secrets"}`. Alternatively, it is possible to create a [custom job provisioner](../operator-guide/manage-jenkins-cd-job-provision.md) with this step.

3. Run the job. The pipeline script will create a secret with the same data in the namespace generated by the cd pipeline.

  !!! Note
      Service account tokens are not supported.
