# Customize CD Pipeline

Apart from running CD pipeline stages with the default logic, there is the ability to perform the following:

* Create your own logic for stages;
* Redefine the default EDP stages of a CD pipeline.

In order to have the ability to customize a stage logic, create a CD pipeline stage source as a Library:

1. Navigate to the **Libraries** section of the Admin Console and create a library with the **Groovy-pipeline** code language:

  !!! note
      If you clone the library, make sure that the correct source branch is selected.

  !![Create library](../assets/user-guide/create-library-choose-type1.png "Create library")

   Select the required fields to build your library:

  !![Advanced settings](../assets/user-guide/create-library-choose-type2.png "Advanced settings")

2. Go to the **Continuous Delivery** section of the Admin Console and create a CD pipeline with the library stage source and its branch:

  !![Library source](../assets/user-guide/cd-pipeline-stage-source.png "Library source")

## Add New Stage

Follow the steps below to add a new stage:

* Clone the repository with the added library;
* Create a "stages" directory in the root;
* Create a **Jenkinsfile** with default content:

      @Library(['edp-library-stages', 'edp-library-pipelines']) _

      Deploy()

* Create a groovy file with a meaningful name, e.g. NotificationStage.groovy;
* Put the required construction and your own logic into the file:

      import com.epam.edp.stages.impl.cd.Stage

      @Stage(name = "notify")
      class Notify {
          Script script
          void run(context) {
          --------------- Put your own logic here ------------------
                  script.println("Send notification logic")
          --------------- Put your own logic here ------------------
          }
      }
      return Notify

* Add a new stage to the STAGES parameter of the Jenkins job of your CD pipeline:

  !![Stages parameter](../assets/user-guide/stages-json.png "Stages parameter")

  !!! warning
      To make this stage permanently present, please modify the [job provisioner](../operator-guide/manage-jenkins-cd-job-provision.md).

* Run the job to check that your new stage has been run during the execution.

## Redefine Existing Stage

By default, the following stages are implemented in EDP pipeline framework:

* deploy,
* deploy-helm,
* autotests,
* manual (Manual approve),
* promote-images.

Using one of these names for annotation in your own class will lead to redefining the default logic with your own.

Find below a sample of the possible flow of the redefining deploy stage:

* Clone the repository with the added library;
* Create a "stages" directory in the root;
* Create a **Jenkinsfile** with default content:

      @Library(['edp-library-stages', 'edp-library-pipelines']) _

      Deploy()

* Create a groovy file with a meaningful name, e.g. CustomDeployStage.groovy;
* Put the required construction and your own logic into the file:

      import com.epam.edp.stages.impl.cd.Stage

      @Stage(name = "deploy")
      class CustomDeployStage {
          Script script

          void run(context) {
          --------------- Put your own logic here ------------------
                  script.println("Custom deploy stage logic")
          --------------- Put your own logic here ------------------
          }
      }
      return CustomDeployStage

## Add a New Stage Using Shared Library via Custom Global Pipeline Libraries

!!! note
    To add a new Custom Global Pipeline Library, please refer to the [Add a New Custom Global Pipeline Library](add-custom-global-pipeline-lib.md) page.

To redefine any stage and add custom logic using global pipeline libraries, perform the steps below:

* Navigate to the **Libraries** section of the Admin Console and create a library with the **Groovy-pipeline** code language:

  !![Create library](../assets/user-guide/create-library-choose-type1.png "Create library")

   Select the required fields to build your library:

  !![Advanced settings](../assets/user-guide/create-library-choose-type2.png "Advanced settings")

* Clone the repository with the added library;
* Create a directory with the name `src/com/epam/edp/customStages/impl/cd/impl/` in the library repository, for instance: `src/com/epam/edp/customStages/impl/cd/impl/EmailNotify.groovy`;
* Add a Groovy file with another name to the same stages catalog, for instance – `EmailNotify.groovy`:

      package com.epam.edp.customStages.impl.cd.impl

      import com.epam.edp.stages.impl.cd.Stage

      @Stage(name = "notify")
      class Notify {
          Script script
          void run(context) {
          --------------- Put your own logic here ------------------
          script.println("Send notification logic")
          --------------- Put your own logic here ------------------
         }
      }

* Create a **Jenkinsfile** with default content and the added custom library to Jenkins:

      @Library(['edp-library-stages', 'edp-library-pipelines', 'edp-custom-shared-library-name']) _

      Deploy()

  !!! note
      `edp-custom-shared-library-name` is the name of your Custom Global Pipeline Library that should be added to the Jenkins Global Settings.

* Add a new stage to the STAGES parameter of the Jenkins job of your CD pipeline:

  !![Stages parameter](../assets/user-guide/stages-json.png "Stages parameter")

  !!! warning
      To make this stage permanently present, please modify the [job provisioner](../operator-guide/manage-jenkins-cd-job-provision.md).

  !!! note
      Pay attention to the appropriate annotation (EDP versions of all stages can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/epam/edp-library-stages/tree/master/src/com/epam/edp/stages/impl/ci/impl)).

* Run the job to check that the new stage has been running during the execution.
