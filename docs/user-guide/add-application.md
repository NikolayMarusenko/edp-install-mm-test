# Add Application

Admin Console allows to create, clone, import an application and add it to the environment. It can also be deployed in Gerrit (if the Clone or Create strategy is used) with the Code Review and Build pipelines built in Jenkins.

To add an application, navigate to the **Applications** section on the left-side navigation bar and click the Create button.

Once clicked, the three-step menu will appear:

* The Codebase Info Menu
* The Application Info Menu
* The Advanced Settings Menu

## The Codebase Info Menu

1. In the **Codebase Integration Strategy** field, select the necessary configuration strategy:

   * **Create** – creates a project on the pattern in accordance with an application language, a build tool, and a framework.

   * **Clone** – clones the indicated repository into EPAM Delivery Platform. While cloning the existing repository,
  it is required to fill in the additional fields as well.

   * **Import** - allows configuring a replication from the Git server. While importing the existing repository,
  you have to select the Git server and define the respective path to the repository.

  !!! note
      In order to use the Import strategy, make sure to adjust it by following the [Enable VCS Import Strategy](../operator-guide/import-strategy.md) page.
      The Import strategy is not applicable for Gerrit.

2. In the **Git Repository URL** field, specify the link to the repository that is to be cloned.
  If the **Import** strategy is selected, specify the following fields:

   !![Select import strategy](../assets/user-guide/import-strategy-app.png "Select import strategy")

12. Select CI pipeline provisioner that will be handling a codebase. For details, refer to the
[Manage Jenkins CI Pipeline Job Provisioner](../operator-guide/manage-jenkins-ci-job-provision.md)
instruction and become familiar with the main steps to add an additional job provisioner.
13. Select Jenkins agent that will be used to handle a codebase. For details, refer to the
[Manage Jenkins Agent](../operator-guide/add-jenkins-agent.md) instruction and inspect the steps that should be done to add a new Jenkins agent.
14. Select the necessary codebase versioning type:

  * **default** - the previous versioning logic that is realized in EDP Admin Console 2.2.0 and lower versions.
  Using the default versioning type, in order to specify the version of the current artifacts, images,
  and tags in the Version Control System, a developer should navigate to the corresponding file
  and change the version **manually**.

  * **edp** - the new versioning logic that is available in EDP Admin Console 2.3.0 and subsequent versions.
  Using the edp versioning type, a developer indicates the version number that will be used for all the artifacts stored
  in artifactory: binaries, pom.xml, metadata, etc. The version stored in repository (e.g. pom.xml) will not be affected or used.
  Using this versioning overrides any version stored in the repository files without changing actual file.

  When selecting the edp versioning type, the extra field will appear:

  !![Edp versioning](../assets/user-guide/edp-versioning-application.png "Edp versioning")

  a. Type the version number from which you want the artifacts to be versioned.

  !!! note
      The **Start Version From** field should be filled out in compliance with the semantic versioning rules, e.g. 1.2.3 or 10.10.10.
      Please refer to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) page for details.
