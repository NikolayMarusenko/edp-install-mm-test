# Pipeline Stages

Get acquainted with EDP CI/CD workflow and stages description.

## EDP CI/CD Workflow

Within EDP, the pipeline framework comprises the following pipelines:

* Code Review;
* Build;
* Deploy.

!!! note
    Please refer to the [EDP Pipeline Framework](pipeline-framework.md) page for details.

The diagram below shows the delivery path through these pipelines and the respective stages. Please be aware that stages may differ for different codebase types.
