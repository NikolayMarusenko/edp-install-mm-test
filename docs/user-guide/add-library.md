# Add Library

Admin Console helps to create, clone or import a library and add it to the environment. It can also be deployed in Gerrit (if the Clone or Create strategy is used) with the Code Review and Build pipelines built in Jenkins.

Navigate to the **Libraries** section on the left-side navigation bar and click the Create button.

Once clicked, the three-step menu will appear:

* The Codebase Info Menu
* The Library Info Menu
* The Advanced Settings Menu

## The Codebase Info Menu

1. In the **Codebase Integration Strategy** field, select the necessary option that is the configuration strategy for the replication with Gerrit:

  * **Create** – creates a project on the pattern in accordance with a code language, a build tool, and a framework.

  * **Clone** – clones the indicated repository into EPAM Delivery Platform. While cloning the existing repository, it is required to fill in the additional fields as well.

  * **Import** - allows configuring a replication from the Git server. While importing the existing repository, select the Git server and define the respective path to the repository.

  !!! note
      In order to use the **Import** strategy, make sure to adjust it by following the [Enable VCS Import Strategy](../operator-guide/import-strategy.md) page.

2. In the **Git Repository URL** field, specify the link to the repository that is to be cloned.

3. With the **Clone** strategy, select the **Codebase Authentication** check box and fill in the requested fields:

  * Repository Login – enter your login data.
  * Repository password (or API Token) – enter your password or indicate the API Token.

  !!! note
      The **Codebase Authentication** check box should be selected only in case you clone the private repository.
      If you define the public repository, there is no need to enter credentials.

4. Click the Proceed button to switch to the next menu.

  ## The Library Info Menu

11. Select the CI pipeline provisioner that will be used to handle a codebase. For details, refer to the [Manage Jenkins CI Pipeline Job Provisioner](../operator-guide/manage-jenkins-ci-job-provision.md) instruction
and become familiar with the main steps to add an additional job provisioner.

12. Select Jenkins agent that will be used to handle a codebase. For details, refer to the [Manage Jenkins Agent](../operator-guide/add-jenkins-agent.md) instruction
and inspect the steps that should be done to add a new Jenkins agent.

13. Select the necessary codebase versioning type:

  * **default** - the previous versioning logic that is realized in EDP Admin Console 2.2.0 and lower versions.
  Using the default versioning type, in order to specify the version of the current artifacts, images, and tags in the Version Control System,
  a developer should navigate to the corresponding file and change the version **manually**.

  * **edp** - the new versioning logic that is available in EDP Admin Console 2.3.0 and subsequent versions.
  Using the edp versioning type, a developer indicates the version number from which all the artifacts will be versioned
  and, as a result, **automatically** registered in the corresponding file (e.g. pom.xml).

  When selecting the edp versioning type, the extra field will appear:

  !![EDP versioning](../assets/user-guide/edp-versioning.png "EDP versioning")

  a. Type the version number from which you want the artifacts to be versioned.

  !!! note
      The **Start Version From** field should be filled out in compliance with the semantic versioning rules, e.g. 1.2.3 or 10.10.10. Please refer to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) page for details.

14. In the **Select CI Tool** field, choose the necessary tool: Jenkins or GitLab CI, where Jenkins is the default tool and
